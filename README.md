<h1>Yet-Another-Youtube-Downloader</h1>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
A Simple Youtube Downloader like the others without any Ai shenanigans.

<h3>Note to Users:</h3>
If you notice that while you press download the app freezes don't panic, <br>
im using a lib called Ffmpeg-python by kkroening to get the best quality and codecs.<br>
<h4>Be aware that the code isn't one of the best.<h4>
Yeah it's poopoo.
For next update im gonna look for implementing rightfully the progressbar and mov fileformat.<br>
Don't know if posix platform works right, I haven't tasted it.
