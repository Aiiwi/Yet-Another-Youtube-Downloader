# Yet-Another-Youtube-Downloader

<h3>Overview:</h3>
Just a simple Youtube downloader made in python made by me just to get better with coding!.

<h3>Features:</h3>
Download YouTube Video or Audio: Easily download YouTube video or audio by providing the video URL.
Gui interface: Yay! very VERY simple gui for easy navigation.

<h3>Note to Users:</h3>
Be aware that the code isn't one of the best im still learning, but for the next updates i wish to revamp the gui with a nice
theme!😵‍💫.

<h3>Thanks for the assets:</h3>
Pytube lib: https://github.com/pytube/pytube

<h3>Problems:</h3>
It might have some problems with the mp3 files because they are just mp4 renamed, 
pytube to my knowledge gives a only audio filter but outputs only a mp4 with no video
so this is my temp fix but i will look into it.
